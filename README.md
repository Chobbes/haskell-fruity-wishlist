# Introduction

This is a wishlist for Haskell libraries and utilities that we seem to be missing from our wonderful ecosystem. One of the major goals for this document is to point out potential low hanging fruit for anybody who needs a project to work on.

Feel free to suggest improvements to existing libraries as well (preferably linking to an issue tracker for this). We should absolutely improve what we can in the existing ecosystem as well! If you're looking for a very nice overview of the current state of the Haskell ecosystem you should definitely [check this out!](https://github.com/Gabriel439/post-rfc/blob/master/sotu.md)

Pull requests, issues, and any feedback are most certainly welcome!
